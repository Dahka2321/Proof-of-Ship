## 🛠️ Problem

**Sovereign Seas** solves the problem of centralized and opaque project funding by creating a decentralized platform where the community has full control over the funding process through on-chain, transparent voting.

## 💡 Solution

We utilize the Celo blockchain to create a voting system where community members can contribute their CELO tokens to vote for projects they want to fund. The most voted projects will receive funding, and the process is fully transparent.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Tech Stack**:
  - Celo Blockchain (Smart Contracts on Celo)
  - React.js (Frontend)
  - Next.js (Web Framework)
  - Hardhat (Smart Contract Deployment)

- **High-level Overview**:
  - Platform contract for managing platform fees and admin controls.
  - Campaign contract for handling project submissions and voting.
  - Treasury contract for managing fund distribution and payouts.
