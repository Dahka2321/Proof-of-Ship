            "description": "ESUSU is a decentralized application (DApp) built on the Celo Mainnet that facilitates stablecoin contributions through a collective savings model known as Esusu in many African communities as well as individual time-locking of funds. The DApp allows users to create and join campaigns, contribute funds, and track campaign details transparently on the blockchain.\n\nEsusu is a 3 in 1 solution to solving issues related to financial inclusion and poor savings trend. the sections are\n\n    Esusu thrift contribution: 5 users join a contribution campaign where they pool their funds every month for 5 months. For every month a unique user takes home the total contribution giving everyone access to bulk money which naturally they couldn't have saved up. This also eliminates the need to borrow money to fund big projects.\n\n    Esusu piggy box => Funds are locked up over time so that users no longer have access to them. They earn MST tokens for locking up funds but lose these tokens if they decide to break the lock.\n\n    Esusu pay bills => Users can pay for their utility and also make donations to their various projects",

We’ve made progress by deploying the contract on Celo mainnet, but it’s not yet integrated into the platform. \n\nWhat We've Accomplished: Smart Contract Deployment: The Contreebution NFT contract is live on Celo mainnet (0x5Ed6240fCC0B2A231887024321Cc9481ba07f3c6), a key step in our blockchain efforts. \n\nWhat We Haven’t Done Yet: Integration: The contract is not yet connected to Treekipedia’s backend or frontend. Users cannot mint NFTs through the platform at this time. \n\nTesting: Beyond deployment, we haven’t completed testing or confirmed full functionality in a live environment. Next Steps: Begin integrating the smart contract with Treekipedia’s backend to link it to the research funding process. Develop the frontend so users can mint NFTs using their Celo wallets. Test the entire system to ensure it works securely and smoothly. The deployment is a milestone, but we’re still early in the process.

        "updates": "Grant update 1: Treekipedia is working toward incentivizing tree species research with the Contreebution NFT, an ERC-721 compliant smart contract. We’ve made progress by deploying the contract on Celo mainnet, but it’s not yet integrated into the platform. Here’s where we stand:\n\n**What We've Accomplished:**\n\nSmart Contract Deployment: The Contreebution NFT contract is live on Celo mainnet (0x5Ed6240fCC0B2A231887024321Cc9481ba07f3c6), a key step in our blockchain efforts.\n\n**What We Haven’t Done Yet:**\n\nIntegration: The contract is not yet connected to Treekipedia’s backend or frontend. Users cannot mint NFTs through the platform at this time.\n\nTesting: Beyond deployment, we haven’t completed testing or confirmed full functionality in a live environment.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\nBegin integrating the smart contract with Treekipedia’s backend to link it to the research funding process.\nDevelop the frontend so users can mint NFTs using their Celo wallets.\nTest the entire system to ensure it works securely and smoothly.\nThe deployment is a milestone, but we’re still early in the process. Full integration is pending, and we’re committed to making this feature a reality for the Celo Proof of Ship event."

Our platform systematically collects and indexes historical funding fee data across EVM, SVM, and Hyperliquid chains, providing users with comprehensive visibility into yield patterns that inform strategic decision-making. This historical data foundation enables users to identify optimal entry and exit points based on empirical performance rather than speculation.\n\nThe platform coordinates complex cross-chain operations through a unified interface that handles position sizing, liquidity sourcing, and slippage management. When capital is deployed, the system allocates USDC efficiently across chains, manages necessary asset bridging, and executes complementary spot and futures positions with appropriate leverage parameters. Our position management system monitors funding rates and maintains delta neutrality, adjusting as market conditions change. By addressing the technical complexities of cross-chain delta-neutral strategies, PerpFlow makes sophisticated yield generation accessible to users who have USDC but lack specialized trading expertise or the time for manual position management across multiple platforms.",

It enables users to create, manage, and attend events, leveraging Mento stablecoins (cUSD, cEUR, cCOP, etc) for seamless payments and ensuring fair transactions via blockchain-based escrow mechanisms.  \n\n**Key Features**  \n\n1. **Decentralized Event Creation & Management**  \n   - Users can create events with details such as date, time, location, and ticket price.  \n   - Events are stored on-chain, ensuring immutability and transparency.  \n\n2. **Trustless Ticketing with Mento Stablecoins**  \n   - Event tickets are purchased using Mento stable assets (cUSD, cEUR, cCOP, etc), ensuring low volatility and predictable pricing.  \n   - Payments are handled without intermediaries, reducing transaction costs.  \n\n3. **Escrow Mechanism for Secure Transactions**  \n   - Ticket payments are held in escrow within a smart contract until event conditions are met.  \n   - If an event is canceled or fails to meet specified criteria, ticket buyers automatically receive refunds in the same Mento token used for purchase.  \n   - This prevents fraud and ensures fair ticketing policies for both organizers and attendees.  \n\n4. **On-Chain Ownership & Verification**  \n   - Each ticket is represented as a blockchain-based asset, ensuring ownership verification and preventing counterfeiting.  \n   - Smart contracts enforce ticket transfer rules, allowing secure resales or transfers.  \n\n5. **Low Transaction Fees & Global Accessibility**  \n   - Built on Celo, a mobile-first blockchain with ultra-low gas fees, making EventChain accessible to users worldwide.  \n   - Users can interact with smart contracts via mobile-friendly wallets like Valora and MetaMask.",
