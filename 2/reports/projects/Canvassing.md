# Project Analysis: Canvassing

## Project Information
- **Name**: Canvassing
- **Description**: Canvassing is a dApp that leverages stablecoins to pay out participants for answering surveys questions. Once a user is on the dApp, they tap on any available survey, book it on-chain and proceed to answer. Once done, they claim the reward, which triggers our smart contract to transfer funds from itself to the requesting participant.

## Code Quality

- **Overall Score**: 6.5/10

### Readability: 7.0/10

The code is generally readable, with clear naming conventions and consistent formatting. However, some components could benefit from more detailed comments, especially in complex logic sections. For example, the `processRewardClaimByParticipantFn` function in `front-end/app/survey/[surveyId]/success/page.tsx` could use more comments explaining each step of the claim process.

### Standards: 6.0/10

The code adheres to some common JavaScript/TypeScript standards, such as using `camelCase` for variable names and consistent indentation. However, there are inconsistencies in the use of `!` for non-null assertion, and some areas could benefit from more robust type checking. For example, the Firebase configuration in `front-end/firebase.ts` uses non-null assertions (`!`) which could lead to runtime errors if the environment variables are not properly set.

### Complexity: 6.0/10

Some components, particularly those handling blockchain interactions and data fetching, exhibit moderate complexity. The `bookSurveyFn` function in `front-end/app/page.tsx` involves multiple asynchronous operations and error handling, increasing its complexity. Refactoring these functions into smaller, more modular units would improve maintainability.

### Testing: 7.0/10

The repository includes unit tests for the smart contracts in the `hardhat/test` directory. However, there's a lack of comprehensive testing for the front-end components and integration between the front-end and back-end services. More thorough testing, including integration and end-to-end tests, would improve the reliability of the application.

## Celo Integration

- **Integrated with Celo**: Yes
- **Integration Depth**: Moderate
- **Overall Score**: 7.0/10

### Celo Features Used

- **Contract interaction (viem)** (Quality: 7.0/10)
  - The application uses viem to interact with smart contracts on the Celo blockchain. The implementation appears correct, but could benefit from more robust error handling and gas optimization.

- **Celo network configuration** (Quality: 8.0/10)
  - The application correctly configures the Celo Alfajores testnet and Celo Mainnet using viem's chain configuration. The use of environment variables for RPC URLs and API keys is a good practice.

- **Signature generation and verification** (Quality: 7.0/10)
  - The application implements signature generation and verification for participant screening and reward claiming. The implementation appears correct, but could benefit from more detailed comments and security considerations.

### Security Assessment

- **Score**: 6.0/10
- **Findings**:
  - The application relies on off-chain signature generation, which introduces a trust dependency on the server-side component. If the server is compromised, malicious signatures could be generated.
  - The application uses non-null assertions (`!`) in several places, which could lead to runtime errors if the expected values are not present.

### Gas Optimization

- **Score**: 5.0/10
- **Findings**:
  - The smart contract code in `hardhat/contracts/ClosedSurveyV6.sol` could benefit from gas optimization techniques, such as using more efficient data types and reducing redundant calculations.
  - The front-end code could be optimized to reduce the number of blockchain calls and minimize data transfer.

### Integration Evidence

- front-end/services/web3/processRewardClaimByParticipant.ts
- hardhat/contracts/ClosedSurveyV6.sol
- front-end/firebase.ts

## Architecture

- **Pattern**: Layered Architecture
- **Overall Score**: 7.0/10

### Data Flow

The data flow starts with user interactions on the front-end, which trigger calls to smart contracts on the Celo blockchain. The front-end also interacts with Firebase Functions for signature generation and webhook processing. Data is stored and retrieved from Firestore database.

### Components

- **Front-end (Next.js)** (Quality: 7.0/10)
  - Purpose: User interface and client-side logic

- **Smart Contracts (Solidity)** (Quality: 6.0/10)
  - Purpose: Blockchain-based survey management and reward distribution

- **Back-end (Firebase Functions)** (Quality: 6.0/10)
  - Purpose: Server-side logic for signature generation and webhook processing

- **Database (Firestore)** (Quality: 7.0/10)
  - Purpose: Data storage for participants, surveys, and rewards

### Architectural Strengths

- Clear separation of concerns between front-end, back-end, and smart contracts
- Use of Firebase for authentication and data storage simplifies back-end development

### Architectural Weaknesses

- Tight coupling between front-end and specific smart contract implementations
- Lack of a well-defined API layer for accessing blockchain data

### Overall Assessment

The project is a functional dApp with a clear purpose and a well-defined architecture. However, it has some security and testing concerns that need to be addressed before deployment to production.

## Recommendations

- **Justification**: Reducing the trust dependency on a single server-side component is crucial for ensuring the security of the application.

- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Implement comprehensive testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the reliability of the application.
- **Justification**: Thorough testing is essential for identifying and fixing bugs before deployment to production.

- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Replace non-null assertions (`!`) with proper validation and error handling to prevent runtime errors.
- **Justification**: Robust validation and error handling improve the stability and user experience of the application.
