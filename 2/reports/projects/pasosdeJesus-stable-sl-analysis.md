## Project Scores

| Criteria | Score (0-10) | Justification |
|----------|--------------|---------------|
| Security | 5.0/10 | Limited information to assess specific security measures. No explicit authentication, authorization, or data sanitization is visible in the provided snippets. |
| Functionality & Correctness | 6.0/10 | The project aims to provide a specific functionality (stable crypto management for Sierra Leone). However, the code snippets don't provide enough detail to assess the correctness of the implementation. No tests are mentioned. |
| Readability & Understandability | 7.0/10 | The README provides a clear overview of the project's goals. The code snippets are relatively clean, but more context is needed to fully assess readability. |
| Dependencies & Setup | 7.5/10 | The `package.json` and `README` provide clear instructions for setting up and running the project. Dependencies are managed using `yarn`. |
| Evidence of Technical Usage | 6.5/10 | The project uses TypeScript, which indicates a focus on type safety and maintainability. The presence of Hardhat suggests smart contract development. However, the provided snippets are insufficient to evaluate the quality of framework integration or API design. |
| **Overall Score** | 6.2/10 | Weighted average based on the individual criteria scores. |

## Project Summary
- **Primary purpose/goal:** To make it easier for people in Sierra Leone to manage stable crypto coins.
- **Problem solved:** Limited access to crypto wallets/exchanges and lack of education about stable crypto coins in Sierra Leone.
- **Target users/beneficiaries:** People in Sierra Leone.

## Technology Stack
- **Main programming languages identified:** TypeScript, JavaScript, Solidity, CSS
- **Key frameworks and libraries visible in the code:** React (inferred from `packages/react-app`), Hardhat (for smart contract development), oclif (command line framework)
- **Inferred runtime environment(s):** Node.js, Web browser

## Architecture and Structure
- **Overall project structure observed:** Monorepo structure with `packages/react-app` for the frontend and `packages/hardhat` for smart contracts.
- **Key modules/components and their roles:**
    - `packages/react-app`: Frontend application for buying/selling stable crypto.
    - `packages/hardhat`: Smart contracts for managing stable crypto transactions.
- **Code organization assessment:** The monorepo structure is a good practice for separating concerns. However, the lack of detailed code snippets makes it difficult to assess the internal organization of each package.

## Security Analysis
- **Authentication & authorization mechanisms:** No explicit authentication or authorization mechanisms are visible in the provided snippets.
- **Data validation and sanitization:** No explicit data validation or sanitization is visible in the provided snippets.
- **Potential vulnerabilities:** Lack of authentication and data validation could lead to vulnerabilities such as unauthorized access and injection attacks.
- **Secret management approach:** No information available in the provided snippets.

## Functionality & Correctness
- **Core functionalities implemented:** The project aims to implement buying/selling stable crypto. However, the provided snippets don't provide enough detail to assess the correctness of the implementation.
- **Error handling approach:** No explicit error handling is visible in the provided snippets.
- **Edge case handling:** No information available in the provided snippets.
- **Testing strategy:** No tests are mentioned in the provided snippets. The `package.json` includes a `hardhat:test` script, suggesting that tests are planned but not necessarily implemented.

## Readability & Understandability
- **Code style consistency:** The use of ESLint and Prettier suggests an effort to maintain code style consistency.
- **Documentation quality:** The README provides a good overview of the project's goals and setup instructions. However, more detailed documentation is needed for the individual components.
- **Naming conventions:** No information available in the provided snippets.
- **Complexity management:** The monorepo structure helps to manage complexity by separating concerns.

## Dependencies & Setup
- **Dependencies management approach:** Dependencies are managed using `yarn`.
- **Installation process:** The README provides clear instructions for installing dependencies and running the project.
- **Configuration approach:** No information available in the provided snippets.
- **Deployment considerations:** The README mentions running the project on `<https://stable-sl.pdJ.app>`, suggesting a web deployment.

## Evidence of Technical Usage

1. **Framework/Library Integration:**
   - The project uses React and Hardhat, which are popular frameworks for frontend and smart contract development, respectively.
   - The presence of `renovate.json` suggests an effort to keep dependencies up-to-date.
   - The use of TypeScript indicates a focus on type safety and maintainability.

2. **API Design and Implementation:**
   - No information available in the provided snippets.

3. **Database Interactions:**
   - No information available in the provided snippets.

4. **Frontend Implementation:**
   - No information available in the provided snippets.

5. **Performance Optimization:**
   - No information available in the provided snippets.

Score: 6.5/10
